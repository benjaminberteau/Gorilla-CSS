      <h2><b>Gorilla do CSS</b></h2>

      <p>This is a site about apes and gorillas. In fact it's a site about primates and CSS. If you had enough primates, all working together, they would produce pretty good style sheets. Maybe.</p>

  <section class="main-content">
    <div class="text-main">
    <p>When Jane Goodall first witnessed Gombe chimpanzee David Greybeard fishing for termites by manipulating blades of grass in 1960, the line between humans and other animals suddenly became blurry. Tool use was no longer uniquely human, leading Dr. Louis Leakey, Jane’s mentor, to famously say, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.” 

    We know that chimpanzees are our closest cousins in the animal kingdom, sharing 98.6% of our DNA. Chimpanzees are also known to exhibit remarkably human-like behaviors, such as grieving over the loss of a loved one, generating strategies to thrive in social groups, and even learning sign language. 

    But what allows us to share these things in common? Is it our brain structure, our shared genetic similarities, or our cultures? Turns out, it’s a mix of many things! </p>
  </div>
 
  <div class="text-main">
    <p>To start, it’s important to understand the chimpanzee “fission-fusion” social system. In this system, there are communities of up to 100 individuals that occasionally come together to eat, socialize, and mate, but spend most of their time in tighter sub-groups.  Early human communities are thought to have lived in similar groups

    Strong alliances, bonds, and intrasexual dominance hierarchies between members make up most of the social dynamics in chimpanzee groups. Through these hierarchies, members of the same sex compete for access to resources such reproductive mates or food, resulting in alpha males and alpha females. Studies of human culture lead us to believe that we too operate with intrasexual hierarchies – just think about the famous myths in which men compete for the heart of a woman to become king!  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-main">
    <p>Although males are dominant overall in chimpanzee groups, the most important relationships are between mothers and their dependent offspring, which we know largely thanks to studies initiated by Jane in the early 1960s. Chimpanzees learn essential life skills from their mothers, including how to pick up on emotional cues, be a good leader, and demonstrate compassion.

    Flo and Gremlin, for example, are two popular and outstanding chimpanzee mothers from Gombe. Gremlin persevered through the hard task of raising twins in the wild, and two of Flo’s sons grew up to become alpha males. Together, they showcase the importance of a strong mother-infant relationship – something humans need as well. </p>
